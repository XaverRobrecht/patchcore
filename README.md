# PatchCore

This repository contains a simple implementation of the PatchCore anomaly detection algorithm, based on the paper *"PatchCore: Efficient Patch-based Outlier Detection"* by R. Schneider et al. (2022). The implementation is designed to be straightforward and easy to use, with a focus on clarity and simplicity.

The PatchCore classifier is implemented as a custom Torch module, enabling seamless integration into PyTorch-based workflows and facilitating export to production environments via ONNX or similar frameworks.

For usage examples, please refer to `example.py`. This script demonstrates typical usage patterns and can serve as a starting point for your own applications.

I plan to eventually publish this package on PyPI for easier accessibility. As the `scikit-learn` and `scikit-image` libraries are currently only used for benchmarking and segmentation generation, I plan to remove them and implement custom methods for computing the AUROC score and detecting contours.

# AUROC Score Benchmark Results on the MVTecAD Dataset

I ran a few test runs with the following settings:
- Nearest neighbors set to 1 (equivalent to no reweighting)
- Patch size set to 3
- Subsampling at 1%
- Feature dimensions as proposed in the [original repository](https://github.com/amazon-science/patchcore-inspection)

As expected, scores fluctuate slightly due to the random first element in subsampling. However, the results are consistent with those reported in the paper.

# Final Comments

I implemented an aggregation function based on average pooling, which I personally find aligns more closely with the description in the paper compared to the original repositoryâ€™s approach. Additionally, it's more transparent, as the workings of adaptive average pooling aren't immediately clear. Note that when using the `AverageAggregator`, the optimal patch size may differ from the values suggested in the paper.
